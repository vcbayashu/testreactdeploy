What react basically does?
 React works on single page application concept.
 which means only one index.html is there.
 Now with the help of React we get control over that one index.html
 file. Now with the help of javascript logic we modify
 that one index.html file and hence our app becomes 
 single page application and hence faster.

What is component?
components are basically like functions which return html/jsx.
In index.js file, we return only one component that is called
the Parent component which App.js. All the other
subcomponents and logic are done inside App.js

Basic things to be taken care while making a component.
1. A component file name must start with Capital letter.
2. A component must return all the html inside a single tag 
generally <></>
3.A component function must also be capitalized
4. In component class is replaced by className.
5. Each component must have closing tags. If there is no closing tag
then use self closing tag in that reference.
e.g. in normal html
<h1></h>
<img src="">
<input type='text' >

but in react
<h1></h>
<img src="" />
<input />

6. Attributes in JSX must be in camelcase convention

7. CSS/styling are used in similar fashion

8. We cannot directly use javascript after return statement. If we want to use js or implement logic 
we do it before return.
9. Whenever we want to use Javascript inside JSX then we can do it inside 
curly brackets {}


Use State
In a component, if we want to update any value
using normal variable declartion and logic, then 
it won't be reflected because a components need to be
re-rendered in order to reflect the changes.
So we need to come up with a solution in which
a component re-render itself on update of any value/state.



let myname = "ashutosh" // normal coding, 
myname = "Satyam" ,no re-render hence no change on update

useState => React // React, component re-render
useState doesn't instantly update the state,
hance updated state isn't accessible just after setstate


Whenever we want to render any tag/element/div/component/jsx according to certain
conditions, then we use conditional statements (if else but in ternay format) inside jsx.
This is called conditional rendering
